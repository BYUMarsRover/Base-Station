checksum???

6 get/set for each thing
turret

elbow
wrist roll
wrist pitch
gripper position/speed

-------------------puppet report


// input from puppet	64 bytes long
$PUPRPT,16bits,16bits,16bits,16bits,16bits,8bit,CHECKSUM(2byte)*
	tur   sho    elb    wrr    wrp    grp
16bits = 65535 maximum if unsigned (give 6 characters)
8bits = 4 characters long
-----------------puppet command

//output to puppet
$PUPCMD,16bits,16bits,16bits,16bits,16bits,8bit,CHECKSUM(2byte)*
	tur   sho    elb    wrr    wrp    grp
mostly 16bit between 0 and 4095
8bit - current draw, necessary?


Checksum = XOR each byte together (i.e. add without carry)
0x00

57600 minimum send/recieve baud (64byte * rate per second * # of bits/byte * 10 real bits for 8 data bits)


synchronization:
Steve always sends at 20 times per second
If he gets something from me and can't read it fast enough, throws it out.

baud rate (for sending and recieving): 115200 (remember this, hard code in)

try/catch for serial port disappearing and make sure you dont KILL EVERYTHING!!!
